**Intro**

This project is practice for development of responsive web design. Page should adjust according to different screen sizes and should always be visually appealing without compromising the quality of the page. User can update their user info and add new cards to the page for anyone to see.

**Skills**

This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and Figma, Node.js and Webpack. It was assembled with consideration of Flexbox and Grid layouts while being adjusted with Media queries to accomodate a variety of screen sizes. Asynchronous programming with Javascript allows for the user to interact with the server without interuping the experience.

**Images**

- Images were brought directly from the Figma design page.
- Additional images can be imported using the "Add" button on the page. You can upload any images of your choosing, provided you have the link address URL for that image.

Page could also have more refinement in the Media Queries used to create an even better visual layout for users of all screen sizes.
