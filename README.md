**Intro**

This project is practice for development of responsive web design. Page should adjust according to different screen sizes and should always be vizually appealing without compromising the quality of the page.

**Skills**

This project was built using HTML, CSS, Git and Figma. It was assembled with consideration of Flexbox and Grid layouts while being adjusted with Media queries to accomodate a variety of screen sizes.

**Figma**

**Images**

Images were brought directly from the Figma design page.

**Github Page**

**Improvements**

Page could be improved with more interactive elements for the user to engage with. The buttons need to be linked to additional pages and to have styles when active. Page could also have more refinement in the Media Queries used to create an even better visual layout for users of all screen sizes.

**Project Video**

Here is an explanation of the website and its features by me.
